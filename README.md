## Alex McGuigan

I call myself a gardener; I believe that software is grown rather than built. Old code just needs a nurturing environment with lots of sunlight and pruning.

I build payment routing algorithms, service integrations, and powerful APIs. But really it's all an excuse to do obsessive research on an obscure and niche topic and bring it to life via code.

I cut my teeth on programming by running Neverwinter Nights (D&D online) servers in high school. In particular, I was an administrator and developer for a popular arena server, Antiworld, with hundreds of regular players and a global team. All of that old code is lost to time and email-based source control, but [@Schmidt-A](https://github.com/Schmidt-A/loi-pyramid) and I did some dabbling together that lives on.

Outside the computer, I'm a organizer for grassroots and mutual aid projects in Queens:
- arts advocacy, free art supplies, community events at [QNS Collaborative](https://instagram.com/qnscollaborative)
- maker markets, community club fair at [31st Ave Open Street Collective](https://instagram.com/31staveopenstreet)
- creative writing, community events at a Western Queens tabletop roleplaying club

Formerly [@flowcommerce](https://github.com/flowcommerce) and [@mastercard](https://github.com/mastercard)
